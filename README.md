# PracticeFiles
A bunch of files containing the different libraries, tools and techniques that I have worked with. These are very simply and straightforward codes run mainly for the understanding of the techniques used in them. Some of them are from online courses that I referred to and ran on my system too. The datasets for each and any further descriptions are given below. 

## PCA_Demo
This is a .ipynb file containing code that has some basic PCA (Principal Component Analysis) functionality to it. Here, I have used an in-built dataset from sklearn on Breast Cancer. The goal of the code was to minimize the number of variables involved - to consider only the most important variables. By doing this, the classification of malignant/bengign becomes easier to interpret and more focused. To facilitate this, the technique of PCA is implemented. By the end of the code, the classification is pretty accurate as shown in the graph. However, which variables were taken as the first and second principal components are still unclear. 

## RF_Demo
This is a .ipynb file containing code that helps to execute a basic, very simple Random Forest Classification. For this, I have used the famous Iris dataset from sklearn. The goal was to classify the flowers' species based on the other variables. Random Forest was used and the accuracy for the predictions was checked. A confusion matrix was created to verify the same.
