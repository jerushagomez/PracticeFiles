# PracticeFiles
A bunch of files containing the different libraries, tools and techniques that I have worked with. These are very simply and straightforward codes run mainly for the understanding of the techniques used in them. The datasets for each and any further descriptions are given below. 

## PCA_Demo
This is a .ipynb file containing code that has some basic PCA (Principal Component Analysis) functionality to it. Here, we are using an in-built dataset from sklearn on Breast Cancer. The goal of the code was to minimize the number of variables involved - to consider only the most important variables. By doing this, the classification of malignant/bengign becomes easier to interpret and more focused. To facilitate this, we use the technique of PCA. By the end of the code, the classification is pretty accurate as shown in the graph. However, which variables were taken as the first and second principal components are still unclear.
